# Facilitator's Guide - Jump Start Workshop: Building Modern AI Applications

Facilitator's guide for conducting the [Jump Start workshop on Building Modern AI Applications](https://github.com/Capgemini/Jump-Start-Build-Modern-AI-Apps).

## Introduction for Facilitators

Jump Start workshops are immersive experiences where participants collaborate in a working environment, utilizing provided resources and requirements. These workshops are not traditional training sessions or labs but rather hands-on experiences designed to foster learning through problem-solving and exploration.

As a facilitator, your role is to guide and encourage attendees to talk through their real world challenges. While you may offer guidance and insights, it's important not to provide direct solutions. The value participants derive from the workshop lies in the satisfaction of coming up with solutions and the deep learning that accompanies the experience.

So, what does facilitating entail?

- **Facilitating Team Collaboration**: Lead team discussions, ensure all members are involved, and provide a platform for brainstorming while keeping the focus on long term challenge resolution.

- **Addressing Technical Issues**: Assist with technical hurdles unrelated to the workshop, such as command line usage or network authentication.

- **Explaining Concepts**: Clarify underlying concepts when necessary to aid understanding, beyond simply providing code solutions.

- **Managing Team Morale**: Recognize and manage team morale, especially during challenging moments. Guide teams through obstacles with leading questions or suggestions.

- **Validating Solutions**: Assess workshop solutions against criteria and celebrate team successes.

## Preparation for Facilitating the Jump Start Workshop on Building Modern AI Applications

Before facilitating the workshop, ensure you are fully prepared.

### 1. Build Foundational Knowledge

Facilitators for the Building Modern AI Applications workshop should be well-versed in Azure Cosmos DB, vector databases, RAG patterns, event sourcing, embedding, Azure OpenAI, application development, and Semantic Kernel orchestration.

Familiarize yourself with the following services and concepts:

**Services:**
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/)
- [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview)
- [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)

**Concepts:**
- [Embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings)
- [Prompt engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/overview/)
- [Effective system prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/system-message)

Understanding the solution accelerator and its functionalities is crucial.

> [Watch the Deep Dive Video](https://aka.ms/vsaia.deepdive) to understand the solution's setup and codebase.

> Utilize the provided [Deep Dive PowerPoint Presentation](./deep-dive/Build_Modern_AI_Apps_Solution_Deep_Dive.pptx) and [Demo Script](./deep-dive/BuildModernAIAppsDeepDiveScript.docx) for comprehensive understanding and potential presentation to clients (note: refrain from presenting to clients before the workshop).

### 2. Complete the Workshop

Ideally, participate in the workshop as a learner or complete the workshop independently to understand the experience firsthand. Attempt to solve business challenges using provided instructions, referring to this guide for additional context only when necessary.

> **Note**: The provided solutions are for reference, but encourage teams to explore alternative paths.

### 3. Prepare to Support Your Team

This document incorporates insights from content authors and experienced facilitators. Read through the guidance to ensure your team has a positive and successful workshop experience.

## Jump Start Guidance

The following sections provide guidance for supporting your team as they navigate through the workshop.

### General Expectations

The workshop comprises frameworks structured to emulate the process of building a modern cloud-native application. Participants enhance an existing retail-based application with an "intelligent agent" enabling user queries on vectorized product, customer, and sales order data. Encourage participants to follow the logical progression of challenges akin to real-world scenario implementations.
