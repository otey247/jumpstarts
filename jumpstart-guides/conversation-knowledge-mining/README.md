# Facilitator's Guide - Jump Start Workshop: Conversation Knowledge Mining

This guide is designed for facilitators conducting the Conversation Knowledge Mining Jump Start Workshop at Capgemini. It provides comprehensive insights and resources to ensure a successful and impactful session.

## Introduction for Facilitators

Capgemini's Jump Start Workshops are tailored to expedite AI initiatives within client organizations by leveraging immersive, hands-on experiences. As a facilitator, your role is pivotal in guiding participants through the complexities of conversation knowledge mining using Azure Cognitive Services and OpenAI technology.

### Key Facilitator Responsibilities:

- **Workshop Leadership**: Drive the agenda, facilitate discussions, ensure active participation, and maintain focus on the objectives.
- **Technical Support**: Address technical issues that arise, such as issues with command line interfaces or network configurations.
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Help participants understand the underlying technologies and methodologies beyond the provided code.
- **Team Dynamics**: Manage morale and expectations, especially when navigating challenging concepts or technical difficulties.
- **Solution Validation**: Evaluate the outcomes of the workshop exercises against set criteria and celebrate successes.

## Preparing for the Workshop

### 1. Build Foundational Knowledge

Facilitators should possess a thorough understanding of the technologies and concepts involved in the workshop. Key areas include:

**Services:**
- Azure Cognitive Search
- Azure OpenAI Service

**Concepts:**
- Conversation summarization
- Key phrase extraction
- Batch speech-to-text processing
- Information sensitivity and redaction
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining

Familiarize yourself with the solution architecture, potential use cases, and the codebase described in the GitHub repository’s README.md file.

### 2. Utilize Provided Resources

- **Deep Dive Video**: Watch the detailed setup and operational guide available [here](https://aka.ms/vsaia.deepdive).
- **PowerPoint Presentation & Demo Script**: Use these tools for a structured presentation and demonstration to workshop participants. Ensure not to present these to clients before the workshop to maintain the learning impact.

### 3. Setup and Deployment Guidance

Prepare by understanding the deployment architecture and how to navigate the Azure portal to manage resources effectively. Encourage participants to explore different deployment strategies and configurations as described in the solution’s README.md file.

## Workshop Execution

### General Guidance:

- **Encourage Exploration**: While a reference solution is provided, motivate participants to experiment with alternative approaches to solve the given problems.
- **Hands-On Involvement**: Ensure that participants are actively engaged in deploying and testing the solution themselves, rather than passively observing.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Offer immediate constructive feedback and guidance to foster a productive learning environment.

## Outcome of the Workshop

Upon completion, participants should be able to:

- Deploy and manage the Conversation Knowledge Mining solution using Azure Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI.
- Understand how to transform raw conversation data into actionable insights through AI-driven analysis techniques.
- Apply the learned concepts to various scenarios within their organization, potentially improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The end goal is to empower participants with both the knowledge and practical skills necessary to initiate and lead AI projects within their respective domains.
