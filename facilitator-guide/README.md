## Roles

### Tech Lead

The Tech Lead holds the primary responsibility for technical readiness. This involves setting up technical infrastructure, providing support for technical issues, ensuring smooth execution of the workshop, and gathering feedback from facilitators. Tech Leads should possess strong leadership skills and expertise in the workshop's subject matter. Responsibilities include:

- Assisting the Project Lead
- Ensuring facilitators are adequately prepared
- Providing technical support and troubleshooting
- Ensuring a high-quality workshop experience
- Collecting feedback from facilitators and participants

### Facilitator

Facilitators oversee the participants assigned to their breakout group during the workshop. The group size should ideally be fewer than 10 attendees to foster collaboration and streamline task delegation. Participants in the breakout group collaborate on the same challenge before progressing to the next one. Facilitators ensure participants remain focused, discourage skipping ahead to subsequent challenges, and guide the group's progress.

Facilitators are not expected to provide direct answers to challenges. Participants have the freedom to approach challenges using any suitable methods or technologies. Facilitators may intervene if a team is struggling or heading in the wrong direction, asking probing questions to prompt critical thinking. If necessary, facilitators can seek assistance from the Tech Lead.

Each workshop has a minimum number of challenges participants must complete for credit. Facilitators should refrain from disclosing which challenge is the final requirement for credit. Additional challenges are considered optional. Participants progress at their own pace, with facilitators intervening if necessary to ensure completion within the allotted time.
